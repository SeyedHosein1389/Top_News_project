Weird News Website
Project Overview
This project is a news website that fetches and displays weird and unusual news articles from around the world. The website is built using Flask (Python) as the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend. It retrieves news data from an API (NewsAPI) and presents it in a structured and visually appealing way.

How It Works
Fetching News

The application requests news articles from NewsAPI using a specific query (q=weird) to get unusual and bizarre news.
It filters the results to display only articles that contain both an image and a summary, ensuring a clean and engaging layout.
Displaying the News

The articles are displayed as cards, each containing:
A headline
A summary
An image (if available)
A "Read More" button linking to the full article
Handling Missing Data

If an article has no image, it is replaced with another article that does have an image.
If there are not enough valid articles, the website will notify users that no news is available.
